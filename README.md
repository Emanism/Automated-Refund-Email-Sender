# Automated-Refund-Email-Sender
This Google Apps Script automates the process of sending personalized refund emails to students who submit a refund request via a Google Form. When a new response is recorded in the "Refund Responses" sheet, the script validates the input and sends a tailored refund confirmation email to the student.
